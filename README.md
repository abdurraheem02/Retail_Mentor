**Cohort Analysis of Retail Data**

## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a cohort analysis on retail data to gain insights into customer behavior, purchase patterns, and customer retention over time. Cohort analysis helps us understand how different groups of customers behave over their lifecycle with the company, providing valuable information for decision-making and targeted marketing strategies.

## Data Source

The retail data used for this analysis is sourced from kaggle. The dataset contains information about customer transactions, order dates, product categories,country and customer id .

## Requirements

To run the cohort analysis code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version x.x)
- Pandas (version x.x)
- Numpy (version x.x)
- Matplotlib (version x.x)
- Google Colab (version x.x) [optional, if using Google Colab]
# Getting started
1. Download the retail dataset from kaggle and place it in the `/data` folder.

2. Open the google colab (or your preferred Python environment) and run the `retail_metor.ipynb` script to execute the cohort analysis.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

```

## Cohort Analysis Results

After running the `cohort_analysis.ipynb` script, the results will be saved in the `/results` directory. The analysis report can be found in `cohort_analysis_report.pdf`, which includes key findings, visualizations, and insights from the cohort analysis.

## Visualizations

Visualizations generated during the analysis will be saved in the `/results/plots` folder. Key visualizations include cohort plots, retention curves.
